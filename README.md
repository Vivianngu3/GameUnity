# Project Sprout for Informatics Capstone 2022 - Team GameUnity 

## Purpose
### Problem Statement
How might 1st-3rd grade teachers in Washington State engage their students in learning about the gardening process so that their students can understand the impact agriculture has on the environment?

### Solution Overview
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused decreasing public elementary school student engagement yet increasing comfortability of low-quality online teaching. This is contributing to falling student reading capability and teachers' lack of incentive to challenge their students further through the incorporation of a science curriculum, leaving students underprepared to handle the increase in greener initiatives. To address these informational gaps, Sprout aims to deliver elementary school students from grades 1-3 an interactive web-based storybook that introduces environmental education while increasing reading proficiencies by incorporating elements of both the English Language Arts Common Core (vocabulary, comprehension, inference, etc.) and Next Generation Science Standards (plant lifecycle, ecosystems, energy, etc.).

## Research
### Key Insights
1) There is a dramatic decrease in reading capabilities/proficiencies from grade 8 and under since 2020 according to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on Quality Education.
2) There was no existing requirement of incorporating a standard science curriculum in elementary schools according to our initial user and literature research.
3) Elementary school teachers have expressed interest to incorporate resources that complement/support what's already expected/required of them by higher-level authorities (principal, district superintendent, etc.). If it makes their job to teach what they need to easier, they will use it.
4) Market resesarch proved that there were a lack of engaging online resources for elementary schoolers to match the massive shift to online learning.
5) Elementary schoolers value heavy illustration, streamlined functionality, and clear directions due to their low attention spans and lower motor capabilities.
6) The solution must be designed in a way where elementary school students are most likely to have access to it. (i.e., a website because public schools create equitable access to web browsers and computers/tablets).

### Continuing Research
Our user research fell short of recruiting enough elementary school students to produce solid insights. We ran into issues when treading the waters of human subject testing and the need for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Though this was not indicated anywhere in our research process on Miro, we had contacted 60+ elemetary school principals in the Seattle area for potential testing and were met with either no response or rejection. We urge future capstone groups who pursue the continuation of this project to:
- Find ways to test with more elementary school students since they are among the users that our solution benefits directly.
- Look into whether content expansion or current content enhancement is more valuable to both elementary school teachers and students. If you choose content enhancement, be sure to research more in-depth the science behind the agricultural process and take note of any key part we may have looked over in the current solution.
- Sit in on an elementary school classroom (if possible), pick up elementary school books in a library, etc. to truly immerse yourself in the experience and take note of the major pain points, especially when it comes to how students are interacting with technology.
- Consult staff and students in the University of Washington College of Education for potential insights on the "science" behind teaching elementary school students.
